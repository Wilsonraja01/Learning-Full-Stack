                Human psychological depression and human emotion 
                are very much interconnected. In computational 
                psychology study, the relationship between depression 
                and emotions is the key to understanding the human 
                behavior. Many research has been done for detecting 
                Depression from image, sound, health etc. 
                Using many algorithms but has not been explicitly 
                taken up yet to find psychological depression. 
                In this project, a Machine learning data classification
                 system is presented in which Support Vector Machine (SVM) 
                 and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) is used for data classification.
                  By employing the dataset, this project examines and identifies
                  people's levels of psychological depression from social media 
                tweets. In order to obtain the psychological depression state of unknown 
                individuals, various text that are associated with psychological depression have also been found.
